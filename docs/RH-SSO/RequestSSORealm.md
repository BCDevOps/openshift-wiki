## Access to Create Realm Request

- An automated realm request application is available in the [Realm-O-Matic](https://realm-o-matic.developer.gov.bc.ca) tool.
- Login with your IDIR account.
- If you do not have access to create a realm request, visit [DevOps Request](https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-requests) and start there.
- Once you have access on Realm-O-Matic, you can go ahead and create the request there.  

Notes:
- Only one open request is allowed at a time. Use RocketChat to contact the [support team](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/realm-o-matic) if you encounter issues.
- The primary contact or product owner within your organization should be a **government employee**.
