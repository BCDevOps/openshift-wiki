## Access to Create Realm Request

- An automated realm request application is available at [Realm-O-Matic](https://realm-o-matic.developer.gov.bc.ca).
- Login with your IDIR account.
- If you don't have access to create a realm request, visit [DevOps Request Repo](https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-requests) and start there.
- Once you have access on Realm-O-Matic, you could go ahead and create the request there. _Note_ that only one open request is allowed at a time. Contact [support team](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/realm-o-matic) if you encounter issues.

Notes:
- At least one of contact/PO should be a Government Employee
