## Support 

### Private Cloud Platform as a Services Support 

Private Cloud Platform Services Team provides ongoing training, virtual events and developer documentation for the OpenShift Platform, and the shared tools installed on the Platform.  

Private Cloud Platform Operations Team at Advanced Solutions ESIT provides 24/7 technical support for the Platform including software and hardware maintenance. 

### Community DevOps Support 

We’re stewards of a community of users who frequently collaborate with us and each other to solve common problems. While we don’t provide application development support, the strong community of Platform users helps each other solve app-level questions. 

### Coming Soon! 

We’re continuously improving our service offering to keep up with the needs of our digital teams: 

**Coming in 2022: New Hosting Tier for the services that span the private cloud and traditional infrastructure** 

Offers a secure connectivity between containers running in the Private Cloud Platform and virtual machines and physical servers in other zones of the Data Centre, and eventually with workloads in the public cloud. 

## Our Value 

We could tell you what we think our value is, but you’re probably more interested in what the product owners and developers who use our platform say. Here’s how they describe the key benefits of our service: 

* High velocity enables rapid delivery of digital apps 

* Secure and trusted 

* Modern and innovative tech stack 

* Creates efficiencies across government through reusable standards and code 

* Collaborative and community oriented 

* Empower teams by giving them control over how they build their app 

## Our Platform Community 

Our service is available to any digital service team in BC government. The teams most likely to be successful are product teams with DevOps capabilities. Developers, DevOps specialists, and tech leads are the primary users of our Platform. 

As members of digital service teams, Product Owners are also a valued and important user group of our service, as they are heavily involved in digital service delivery decision-making and accountable for the value delivered by the applications on the Platform. 

We prioritize strong, personal relationships with our users and function as a “team of teams”: a network of many smaller teams from multiple business areas who come together to achieve common goals. Our users see us as their collaborators, advocates and co-pilots in their mission to deliver efficient, high-quality digital services to citizens. 

To foster a community of openness and collaboration, we engage over multiple communication channels, such as: 

*  Documentation and knowledge sharing platforms (DevHub at https://developer.gov.bc.ca, GitHub at http://www.github.com) 

*  Online collaboration tools (MS Teams, [Rocket.Chat](http://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/)) 

*  Virtual events (e.g., Platform Community Meetups meetings, Live Help Sessions and developer workshops) 

*  Email mailing lists for Platfomr updates(sign up with the [Platform Services Comms Subscription Service](https://subscribe.developer.gov.bc.ca))

*  One-on-one communications (personalized support with how to effectively leverage OpenShift Platform for the teams that need it)

## Our Stakeholders 

While our closest partners are the developer community and members of our team of teams, we also work closely with the DevExchange Lab and Enterprise Hosting Services to deliver our services. 

We have a number of stakeholders who have input and interest in our service, including: Executive sponsors, ministry and sector MCIOs, MISOs, Digital Investment Office (DIO), Ministry ISB/IMBs, Enterprise Architecture and the OCIO Information Security Branch (including Security Operations Centre). 

External contractors also help us with our mission, notably Advanced Solutions ESIT (through the agreement with the OCIO Enterprise Hosting Services ranch), Arctiq (our delivery partner for Platform improvements), RedHat (our trusted partner that provides enterprise support for the OpenShift software), and the vendors that provide our shared automation, security, monitoring and communications tools. 

## How we run and maintain our service 

Our work can be divided into three main categories: 

*  Platform administration: Approving and setting up namespaces for users on the Platform, running the [Platform Project Registry](https://registry.developer.gov.bc.ca/public-landing), development and maintenance of the OpenShift 4 Platform, building and maintaining Platform’s shared tools ([Vault Secret Management Service](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/BC-Government-Vault-Secrets-Management), Aqua Container Scanning Service, [Artifactory](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/BC-Government-Artifact-Repository-Service-Definition), [Sysdig App Monitoring Service](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/BC-Government-Sysdig-Monitoring-Service-Definition), [EnterpriseDB HA Service for PostgreSQL databases](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/BC-Government-EDB-Operator-Service-Definition), [Rocket.Chat](http://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/)) 

*  Platform leadership: Customer relationship management, stakeholder engagement, cost management 

*  Education + outreach: Documentation, building, maintaining and contributing to a community, knowledge sharing / working in the open, OpenShift training 

Skilled people, modern technology and our vendor partners help us do this work, and we also rely on significant executive buy-in in the form of support, advocacy, trust and willingness to allow us to take managed risks. 

## Funding Our Service 

The Private Cloud Platform as a Service is currently funded through core OCIO funding, with technology improvements funded through capital. Based on requests from ministries, the funding model for all OCIO shared services is currently being reviewed to make sure that it aligns with client needs and supports sustainable service delivery. As part of this review, we’ve explored funding model questions with our team and our users. 

Our users have told us that, under any funding model, some aspects of the service should continue to be supported by core funding: hosting applications under a certain resource usage threshold, training and documentation, community support, and support for our service’s shared tools. 

Users of our service have also told us that any funding model should be transparent, simple and easy.  

OCIO as a whole and the Platform Services Team will continue working with our users to develop funding model options. Our goal is to start consultations with the Platform Community about funding model changes, if any, in late summer 2021, with an implementation target of the fiscal year 2022/2023.
