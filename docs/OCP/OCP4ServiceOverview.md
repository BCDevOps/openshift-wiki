##Our users and user relationships 

Our service is available to any digital service team in BC government. The teams most likely to be successful are product teams with DevOps capabilities. Developers, DevOps specialists, and tech leads are the primary users of our service. 

Product Owners are also a valued and important client group, as they’re heavily involved in their digital service delivery decision-making and accountable for the value delivered by the applications on the Platform. 

We prioritize strong, personal relationships with our users and function as a “team of teams”: a network of many smaller teams from various business areas who come together to achieve common goals. Our users see us as their collaborators, advocates and co-leads in the mission to deliver efficient, high-quality digital services to citizens. 

To foster a community of openness and collaboration, we engage in a variety of communication channels, such as: 

*  Documentation and knowledge sharing platforms (DevHub at https://developer.gov.bc.ca, GitHub at http://www.github.com) 

*  Online collaboration tools (MS Teams, Rocket.Chat) 

*  Virtual events (e.g., Platform Community Meetups meetings, Live Help Sessions and developer workshops) 

*  Email mailing lists (sign up to the Platform Services Comms Subscription Service at https://subscribe.developer.gov.bc.ca) 

*  1 on 1 communications (personalized support for the teams that need it) 

##Our stakeholders 

While our closest partners are the developer community and members of our team of teams, we also work closely with the DevExchange Lab and Enterprise Hosting Services to deliver our services. 

We have a number of stakeholders who have input and interest in our service, including: Executive sponsors, Ministry MCIOS, MISOs, Digital Investment Office (DIO), Ministry ISB/IMBs, Enterprise Architecture and the OCIO Information Security Branch (including Security Operations Centre). 

External contractors also help us with our mission, notably DXC Advanced Solutions (through the agreement with the Hosting Services Branch), Arctiq, RedHat and our tool/feature vendors. 

##How we run and maintain our service 

Our work can be divided into three main categories: 

*  Platform administration: Approving and setting up namespaces for users, running the Platform Registry, development and maintenance of the OpenShift 4 Platform itself, building and maintaining Platform’s Next Gen Security tools (Vault, Aqua, Artifactory, Sysdig, EnterpriseDB, repo-mountie, etc.) 

*  Platform leadership: Customer relationship management, stakeholder engagement, cost management 

*  Education + outreach: Documentation, building, maintaining and contributing to a community, knowledge sharing / working in the open, OpenShift training 

Skilled people, modern technology and our vendor partners help us do this work, and we also rely on significant executive buy-in in the form of support, advocacy, trust and willingness to allow us to take managed risks. 

##Funding our service 

The Private Cloud Platform as a Service is currently funded through core OCIO funding, with technology improvements funded through capital. Based on requests from ministries, the funding model for all OCIO shared services is currently being reviewed to make sure that it aligns with client needs and sustainable service delivery. As part of this review, we’ve explored funding questions with our team and our users. 

Both the platform team and our users agree that some aspects of the platform should continue to be free: hosting applications under a certain resource usage threshold, training and documentation, community support, and support for our service’s shared services. 

We’ve identified some potential future revenue themes: 

*  Large or specialized hosting: Above the threshold resource usage (high CPU, RAM or storage use) and hosting in the Gold tier for business mission critical apps 

*  Specialized support: For example, advanced/personalized user support for product teams that need it, expert services (packaged DevOps, consultants, technical and security reviews for apps), app analytics and monitoring, customized developer training 

Users of our service agree that, if we do introduce a cost associated with the platform, it’s important for the cost model to be transparent, simplified and easy to use. 

OCIO as a whole and the Platform Services Team will continue working with our users to develop funding model options. Our goal is to start consultations with the Platform Community about the new funding model in summer 2021, with an implementation target of the fiscal year 2022/2023.
