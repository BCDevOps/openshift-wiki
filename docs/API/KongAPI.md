# API Management Services.
 
## Current gateway status
* APIs already behind GW https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?tags=API
* BCGOV API registry (API published under OpenAPI Specs) https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/group/bc-government-api-registry
* enabled for wildcard TLS+SNI for ```*.api.gov.bc.ca```
* current Gateway backend - Kong (https://github.com/kong/kong) API gateway 
  * Used for common logic like rate-limit, app2app authentication like apiKeys, token, keycloak oidc.etc

## Service overview
* https://github.com/bcgov/gwa/wiki/Developer-Guide
* https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/api-gateway-administration

## OpenAPI specs 
Published https://github.com/bcgov/api-specs
 
## Samples
* DataBC demo, this site https://data.gov.bc.ca/ is entirely driven by API https://dbcfeeds.api.gov.bc.ca/ no db backend
* external client production API https://www.workbc.ca/api, WorkBC manage and host their own API but proxy via our gateway for common features like ratelimit, SSL,
 
## Hooks with OCP
* current Kong cluster is running parallel with OCP Kamloops cluster in Zone D plus RRDNS across from Kamloops/Calgary Datacenter
* backend API, you can host your API anywhere, e.g. OCP Kamloops cluster
* Kong Cluster Production is running on a mixed of RHEL VMs and Physical Servers across from Kamloops and Calgary datacenter.
 
## Roadmap and future development,
* OpenAPI Specs is version 3
*  UI (GWA), you are welcome to connect with us directly if you need specific features assume we donâ€™t have already, also welcome to contribute, the source code is internal at the moment and we are working with IP office to make it OSS if possible.   
* IP Anonymous for API/Pods behind Gateway
