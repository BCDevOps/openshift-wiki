# Introduction

BC Gov maintains a set of "organizations" in GitHub where BC Gov digital product teams store and collaborate on the code and other digital materials they develop.  These organizations are as follows:

[bcgov](http://github.com/bcgov/) - used for the majority of BC Gov open source code and artifacts
[bcgov-c](http://github.com/bcgov-c/) - restricted org used by a small number of BC Gov project for storage of source code and artifacts that will ultimately become open source
[bcdevops](http://github.com/bcdevops/) - organization used for providing access control to DevOps platform, and storage of a set of code and artifacts related to the platform. Not applicable for this document.    

This document describes the process for requesting user access to the `bcgov` and `bcgov-c` organizations.  Access to the DevOps platform (and thereby the `bcdevops`org ) is described [elsewhere](../OCP/RequestUserAccess.md). The process for *creating* repositories is also described elsewhere. 

# Requesting for access
See the instructions [here](../OCP/RequestGitHubUserAccess.md).
